Problem Set   1

To   carry   out   this   problem   set,   you   will   need   a   computer   running   Microsoft   Excel.   You   can   use   data   from   https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/historical   and compute   returns for   Question 5 based on Close/Last prices ignoring dividends. You can also consult the guidelines   described in the attached file   Getting_Data.pdf.This   problem   set   is   due   by   1:59pm   PT   on Wednesday,   February   12,   2025. Your   solutions   should   be   in the form   of a   single   Excel   file with   each   question answered   in   a   separate   sheet. You   can   make   use   of   the   template   provided   separately.   Make   sure   to   include   the   names   of   all   people   in   your   team somewhere obvious inside the file. Submit the file on Brightspace. It is all team members’   responsibility   that the   problem   set   is   submitted   on   time.   It   is   sufficient   if one   of the   team   members      makes a   submission.
Question   1
You deposited $100,000 in a margin account and proceeded to buy $150,000 of stockin GRPN. There   is a   30% maintenance   margin required by your   broker.If the   price   of GRPN   falls by   60%,   how   much   cash will your broker   require   you   to   send   if you   are   to   keep him from   selling your positions? What   if GRPN   falls   by   30%?   By   what   percent   does   GRPN   have   to fall before you will receive   a   margin   call?
If GRPN   falls   by   60%   and you   are   unable to   send   any   additional   cash, what   is the   minimum   fraction   of   your holdings in   GRPN that your broker will liquidate?


Question   2Suppose   you   have   $50,000 in   cash   in   your   brokerage   account. You   then   short   sell   20   sharesofTSLA,   currently   priced   at   $1500   per   share. What   is   the   dollar   gain   or   loss   on your   portfolio,   over   the   next   year,if   TSLA   falls   to   $1250 per   share?
What would have   been the gain or loss on your portfolio had you   bought   (using   margin)   50   shares   of   TSLA instead?
For   both   parts   of the   question,   assume   that   the   interest   rate   for   b代 写FBE 555: Investments Spring 2025Matlab

Question   3Without   relying   on   published   NAV   figures, but using   data   from the   ETF’s   own website,   compute the   net asset value   (on aper share basis) of   the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (ticker symbolSMH).   Specify      clearly      the      date      on      which      this      calculation      was      made.      Compare      this      value      with      the   contemporaneous market price per share   of SMH.
Question 4Assume that the market price of SMH was $1 higher than the   value that you actually   observed.   If   you   were the manager of   a large hedge fund, would you see this as a profitable trading opportunity? What   would   you   expect   as   a   rate   of return   on   that   trade?   What   would   you   do   if the   price   of SMH   was   $1   lower?
Question   5
Download the last   10 years   of daily returns   on three assets:
1.   One   SP   500   Index   ETF
2.   One stock that is in the   Dow Jones   Industrial Average
3.   One stock with a market capitalization   of $100   million   or   less.
Compute the mean and standard   deviation   of each. Assess   whether   any   of   the   assets   displays   return behavior. that is inconsistent with the normal distribution.
Question   6Assume   that   the   number   of   shares   outstanding   in   the   two   stocks   from   question   5   has   not   changed   over the last ten years.   Compute the returns   on   equal weighted   and   value   weighted   portfolios   of the   two   stocks   (not the   ETF). The return   on an   equal weighted   portfolio   is just   the   50/50   average   of the   returns of   the two stocks. The return on the value weighted   portfolio   is w1      R1      + w2      R2, where   Ri    is the   return   on   stock   i   and   wi      is   the   market   capitalization   of   stock   i   divided   by   the   sum   of   the   market   capitalizations of both stocks.What are the correlations between each of   the stocks   and the value weighted portfolio? What are the   correlations with the   equal weighted portfolio? Why do   you   think   that   some   correlations   are   higher   than   others?
